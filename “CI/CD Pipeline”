# 6. CI/CD Pipeline
**A CI/CD pipeline** integration and continuous deployment pipeline is a series of automated processes that enables the team to build and deploy code efficiently and reliably. The integration of codes changes automatically, runs tests, and deploys applications without manual intervention. The automation will speed development and reduce errors, and maintain the highest quality throughout the lifecycle of software.
   - **Consistency**:
     To automate testing and deployment, ensure each code change is tested the same way, and minimize manual errors.
   - **Speed**:
     For rapid builds and tests to accelerate the feature delivery, fixes the bug, and enhancements, faster releases allow quick feedback.
   - **Early Issue detection**:
     To automate tests, catch the bugs and dependencies of the issues before they reach production, and to improve the software standard quality.
   - **Collaborations**:
     Contribution integrations are frequently used to reduce conflicts and simplify code review. 
   - **Reliable Deployment**
     Deployments are predictable and repeatable whether to production or staging

# **Tool recommendations**:
   - **Github Action**
     It's used for building and deployment workflows directly within GitHub repositories and automating tests.
   -  **Docker**
     It will be used for testing and for building consistent containers across the deployment. and production. 

Using this **CI/CD Pipeline**, the project will benefit safely, faster, and even more reliable development cycles to deliver key features and fixes to users with confidence.
