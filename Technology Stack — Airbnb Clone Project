## ⚙️ Technology Stack — Airbnb Clone Project

This Airbnb Clone is built using a modern, scalable backend architecture designed for performance, modularity, and clean API communication.

### 🧩 Backend Framework
- **Django** — Core backend framework powering authentication, ORM, admin dashboard, and server‑side logic.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** — Provides clean, maintainable RESTful API endpoints with serialization, permissions, and pagination.

### 🗄️ Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL** — Reliable, ACID‑compliant relational database used for storing listings, bookings, users, and transactions.

### 🔍 API Query Language
- **GraphQL** — Enables flexible, client‑driven data fetching for optimized frontend performance.

### ⚡ Asynchronous Processing
- **Celery** — Handles background tasks such as sending booking notifications, processing payments, and scheduled jobs.
- **Redis** — In‑memory data store used for caching, session management, and as Celery’s message broker.

### 📦 Containerization & Deployment
- **Docker** — Ensures consistent development and production environments.
- **Docker Compose** — Orchestrates multi‑service setup (web, database, redis, celery).

### 🔁 DevOps & Automation
- **CI/CD Pipelines** — Automated workflows for testing, building, and deploying updates to the project.

### 🛠️ Additional Tools
- **Gunicorn** — Production WSGI server for running Django.
- **CORS Headers** — Enables secure communication between backend and frontend clients.
