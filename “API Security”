# 5. 📈 API Security

**API Security** This section outlines the crucial security measures implemented for the Airbnb-clone-project backend. It explains their importance in protecting user data, securing financial transactions, and maintaining system trustworthiness.

   - **REST API**: Detailed documentation available through the OpenAPI standard, including endpoints for users, properties, bookings, and payments.
   - **Django REST Framework:** Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
   - **GraphQL API**: Provides a flexible query language for retrieving and manipulating data.

**Key Security Measures**

   - **Authentication**:
     Enforces strict verification of user identity using robust methods (JWT tokens, OAuth2, or session-based auth). All sensitive API endpoints require authentication to prevent unauthorized access.

   - **Authorization**:
     Limits access so users can only interact with their own data (e.g., bookings, payments, reviews); admin-level endpoints require higher permissions.
     Object-level and role-based checks prevent data exposure across accounts.

   - **Rate Limiting**:
     Applies request throttling on high-value endpoints like login, booking, and payments.
     Prevents brute-force attacks, API abuse, and Denial-of-Service (DoS).

   - **Input Validation & Sanitization**:
     All API parameters and request bodies are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and malicious inputs.

   - **HTTPS Enforcement**:
     All traffic between clients and the server is encrypted to defend against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

   - **Audit Logging & Monitoring**:
     Auth events, payment transactions, and admin actions are logged and monitored for suspicious behavior.
