# 3. üèó **Database Design**

Relational database design is essential for managing the platform‚Äôs data scalability, functionality, and integrity.

**The key entities and the key fields**
  ### 1. Users
- Id (primary key)
- Name
- Email address
- Role (Host, Admin, Guest)
- Created_at
  The relationship: each user can own multiple properties and create multiple bookings.
  ### 2. Properties
- Id (primary key)
- Owner_id (foreign key to users)
- Title
- Location
- Price
  Relations: Each property is owned by only one user but can have many bookings and reviews.
  ### 3. Bookings
- Id (Primary Key)
- User_id (Foreign Key to Users)
- Property_id (Foreign Key to Properties)
- Check_in_date
- Check_out_date
- Status (pending, confirmed, canceled)
  The relationship between each booking is linked to one user and opens one property. A user can make many bookings, and a property can be booked many times.
  ### 4. Payment
- Id (primary key)
- Booking_id (foreign to bookings)
- Amount
- Status (Paid, Failed, Refunded)
- Payment_date
  The relationship between each payment is linked to the booking. Typically, each booking has one payment record. 
  ### 5. Reviews
- Id (primary Key)
- User_id (foreign key to users)
- Property_id (foreign to properties)
- Rating
- Comment
  The relationship: the review is written by each user for a property. Multiple users can review a property, and users can leave multiple reviews for different properties.

  # The list of the relationship entity:
   - Users: one-to-many. Each user owns many properties.
   - User-bookings: One-to-many, a user creates many bookings.
   - Property-bookings: a one-to-many property can book multiple times.
   - Property reviews: One-to-many. Property can receive reviews from various users.
   - Booking payments: One-to-one, each booking results in one payment record.
   They enable comprehensive management of users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments while ensuring data integrity and supporting the complex queries for platform functionality.

# 5. üìà API Security

**API Security** This section outlines the crucial security measures implemented for the Airbnb-clone-project backend. It explains their importance in protecting user data, securing financial transactions, and maintaining system trustworthiness.

   - **REST API**: Detailed documentation available through the OpenAPI standard, including endpoints for users, properties, bookings, and payments.
   - **Django REST Framework:** Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
   - **GraphQL API**: Provides a flexible query language for retrieving and manipulating data.

**Key Security Measures**

   - **Authentication**:
     Enforces strict verification of user identity using robust methods (JWT tokens, OAuth2, or session-based auth). All sensitive API endpoints require authentication to prevent unauthorized access.

   - **Authorization**:
     Limits access so users can only interact with their own data (e.g., bookings, payments, reviews); admin-level endpoints require higher permissions.
     Object-level and role-based checks prevent data exposure across accounts.

   - **Rate Limiting**:
     Applies request throttling on high-value endpoints like login, booking, and payments.
     Prevents brute-force attacks, API abuse, and Denial-of-Service (DoS).

   - **Input Validation & Sanitization**:
     All API parameters and request bodies are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and malicious inputs.

   - **HTTPS Enforcement**:
     All traffic between clients and the server is encrypted to defend against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

   - **Audit Logging & Monitoring**:
     Auth events, payment transactions, and admin actions are logged and monitored for suspicious behavior.

----

# 6. CI/CD Pipeline
**A CI/CD pipeline** integration and continuous deployment pipeline is a series of automated processes that enable the team to build and deploy code efficiently and reliably. The integration of codes changes automatically, runs tests, and deploys applications without manual intervention. The automation will speed development and reduce errors, and maintain the highest quality throughout the lifecycle of software.
   - **Consistency**:
     To automate testing and deployment, ensure each code change is tested the same way, and minimize manual errors.
   - **Speed**:
     For rapid builds and tests to accelerate the feature delivery, fixes the bug, and enhancements, faster releases allow quick feedback.
   - **Early Issue detection**:
     To automate tests, catch the bugs and dependencies of the issues before they reach production, and to improve the software standard quality.
   - **Collaborations**:
     Contribution integrations are frequently, to reduce conflicts and simplify the review of code. 
   - **Reliable Deployment**
     Deployments are predictable and repeatable whether to production or staging

# **Tool recommendations**:
   - **Github Action**
     It's used for building and deployment workflows directly within GitHub repositories and automating tests.
   -  **Docker**
     It will be used for testing and for building consistent containers across the deployment. and production. 

Using this **CI/CD Pipeline**, the project will benefit safely, faster, and even more reliable development cycles to deliver key features and fixes to users with confidence.
